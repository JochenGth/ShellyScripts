# ButttonAndPIRSingleInput
This scripts allow to connect a pir and a push button in parallel to a singel channel of a shelly plus device.
It differentiates a PIR signal from a push button press by the on duration.

To use this script you need to configure your PIR to a short on time e.g. 3 seconds (can be configured via key value store), a push button and a shelly plus device which can run it.
